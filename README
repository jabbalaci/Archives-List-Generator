CHANGELOG

2011-03-27 v0.2.1: <!--more--> is added after the 5th entry
2011-03-12 v0.2:   Some small improvements: categories are added too, they are
                   shown first; after each category and tag there is an external 
                   link to wordpress.com tags, thus you can check easily what others
                   say about the same topic; category and tag links have tooltips.
2011-02-23 v0.1:   initial version
